If you like to keep your commits tidy, you will really<br> appreciate the ability to choose not only which files to commit, but also which parts within those files<br> to commit. </li> \n <li><strong>Connect to your code</strong>. PyCharm 2018.1 makes it easier than ever to connect to a remote<br> Python interpreter using SSH. Whether you’re coding on a Raspberry Pi or an EC2 box, try it now! </li> \n <li><strong>Python 3.7</strong>. Even though Python 3.7 won’t be released until this summer, it’s already<br> supported in PyCharm.
